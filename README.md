### Current Theme: Neubrutalism

* **`style.css`**: A bold and edgy UI with high contrast, solid black borders, and hard-edged shadows. It uses a palette of bright, primary colors for an unapologetically digital look.

### Other Available Themes

* **Modern Dark**: A sleek, dark-themed interface perfect for low-light environments.
* **Soft UI (Neumorphism)**: A unique and tactile design that uses soft shadows and highlights to make UI elements appear as if they are extruding from the background.
